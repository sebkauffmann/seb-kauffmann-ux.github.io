        <p>
            Since the last 10 years or so the way we consume media has been completely changed. People can now stream music, film, read e-books... Not so long ago people were buying Cds, renting and returning film to the video store. Through these changes remained such institution like libraries pretty much the same and tried to diversify their offer. This led me to think. How might we join the convenience of the actual technology to a classical institution like the library? 
            <br><br>
            The task to improve the overall experience of the library user is no easy endeavour as the offer of most public library is already very complete. I definitely had to dig in deeper to find ways of improvement and identify possible innovative solutions. In order to do that, I used different design thinking methods that I deemed relevant to explore in order to find possible solutions.

                The task to improve the overall experience of the user in the library is a very broad one 
                and the offer of most public library is already very complete. I definitely had to dig in deeper 
                to find ways of improvement and identify possible innovative solutions. In order to do that I

                inspiration.
                <br>
                I used the double diamond design principle in order to have a strong definition of the problem. Then I had all the elements needed to be able to design a better solution.

<p>In order to rethink and get out of our traditional conception of the library, I used the following brainstorming method in order to expand the range of possibilities of action. The method is called the ‘’Problem Statement Reframing Method’’. The goal is to change a few word around a statement in order to broaden the audience, place and purpose of a given service. This exercise was done with a sample of 12 users. Here’s a sample of the findings. </p>

    What I wanted to find out was: what are the pushing people to turn away from the library. What are the hurdles?  What system are people using instead? I mean everyone is talking about saving the environment, then why order brand new books just for you when you can borrow them at your library.

                The most interesting and revealing method was the ‘‘Value Proposition Canvas’’. The proposition of a library is in my opinion extremely attractive but yet I still encounter many people who prefer to just order books online. Looking in detail at the possible causes for this was very informative and thought provocative. The following diagram allows us to have a detailed and separate overview of the service and it’s perception of the user.         </p>

            Through interviews I also found out the motivation from the people who are using other sources to get the books that they love to read. For example, people turning to amazon or other online sellers to get new books. A massive trend is also going towards used books online seller as they offer very cheap prices and a great selection. I made the following chart to visualize the strength and weakness of each channel of delivery.

            <h1>Problem definition</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Not so long ago there was a time when people would go to a video store to rent movies and then watch them at home. The task was tedious and people had to do with what was available. One company came and revolutionized this business model. You are probably familiar with the streaming service that they now offer but actually Netflix started out as a mail order system. People would order Dvds and have them delivered home. They had a few weeks to watch them and would then conveniently return them in the mail. Such ideas stuck in my mind as to how to change the method to deliver content to the user. This inspired me to improve the experience in a public library.
             <br>
             <br>
             This led me to think: <br>
            </p>




                    <div class="block">
                <h3> How might we bring the library to the user and not the other way around ?</h3>

            </div>

  

        <div class="h1-biblio">
            <h1>Proposed User jouney</h1>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <p>
    With all these information, I imagined the following system where the user could order books and have them delivered home.
        </p>

        <p>I then came up with the idea of having a delivery system to improve the convenience of the public library while combining elements of online shopping / home delivery. In order to do so, I imagined a system that the library user could use to conveniently order books from the library and have them delivered to his home. Therefore, he wouldn’t have to go there during the opening hours and go through the stacks looking for his books. In exchange, he would pay a small fee similar to the one he would be paying to be using a used online bookstore. And since the delivery would be done in the city, it would be done with a bike messenger system to reduce to a maximum the C02 footprint. The user could then either drop his books at his nearby library using the overnight drop box or have a scheduled pickup.

            <p>During the test phase, the user found it easier to navigate with the top menu (menu B). Also, an additional factor is that the number of screens to navigate through is fairly small and the user don't need to switch often bewteen different screens. </p>

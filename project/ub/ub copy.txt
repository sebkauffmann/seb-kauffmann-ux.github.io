			<h2>Redesign of the booking system of the University of Leipzig</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Due to the Coronavirus the University of Leipzig decided to reopen partially the libraries and allow users to book a working space for a few hours. In order to control the different rules put in place and mainly the distance rule, users need to log in to a website and book a space for a specific amount of time. The website is a great example of a design of a website that did not use the User centered approach due to the many flaws in the function of the website. I took upon the task of doing a redesign of the website.</p>

			<p>When the website first launched the server instantly crashed and they had to postpone 			the launch. I believe the amount of request was really not expected. 			
			I had the chance to talk to one of the employee at one of the biggest branch of the 				university. The university of Leipzig has about 10 branches of different sizes. I was also 			interested in the work going behind the scenes and what needs to be done by the staff. As 			of right now, the user need to check in by the security, which is a first check. Then 				there is twice a day a staff employee going around and double-checking that the booked 				spaces are being used and not vacant. And they mentioned that on a given day there are 500 			to 600 bookings per day. Of that amount they need to cancel 70 to 80 spots per day. </p>
			<br>
			<p>In the best case scenario there is enough space for all the request and that the server 			is not overloaded. And when the server is overloaded either you need to wait a few minutes 			to be able to log in or loading times are extremely long. When the user is stressed and 			just want to work on their papers, the last thing they want to worry about is to wrestle 			for a space.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>Out of this frustration are the optimal choices of features discarded or booking more 			than what they actually need. 
			Right now you are able to book a week in advance but everyday at about 8 am all the 				places for the upcoming week are already booked. This is due to many different problems. 			For example there is no maximum time allowed, so a user could book a space for 12 hours 			and show up when and if he feels like it. In case he doesn’t, there is no fine or 				following restriction. So someone could do that all week long. That’s why I was sitting in 			the computer room alone for a whole day without seeing anyone and still had trouble 				booking a space.</p>

			<p class="clear"> Now when people are booking they play the roulette and put a random place and don’t 				bother putting the amenities that they need out of frustration. That’s why you see someone 			sitting at a computer with their own laptop because there is no default setting for a 				basic equipment. </p>
			<br>
			<p>The cancellation system is very problematic. Once someone went through all these tasks just to be able to get a spot, they would need to log in again to be able to 				release their place. Right now the release system works as is. You need to log in the 				system again, with your credentials (that are not being saved)  and enter the booking 				code. That is once again assuming that the system is not overloaded and students have 				nothing else better to do. In reality no one thinks about this nor wants to take the time 			to do it since the system is usually overloaded and there is absolutely no real benefit 			for the user to do it since there is no punishment whatsoever if he doesn’t do it. </p>
